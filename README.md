# csgo_glicko2

This repository includes code to rank CS:GO pro teams with [Mark Glickman's Glicko-2 Algorithm](http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html) with an own `R` implementation. Data on team's reults comes from [HLTV.org](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188&statsfilter=0&offset=0) and is scraped using a `python` script.

## Running the Analysis

* `scraper.py` conatins code for scraping the data from [HLTV.org](http://www.hltv.org/). There are also some Tests at the end.
* `glicko2.R` contains code for calculation rating updates (it follows closely Mark Glickman's suggested implementation which can be found [here](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf)).
* `analyze.R` loads the data generated by `scraper.py` and runs the subsequent updates for Glicko-2 ratings.

the code is subject to further cleaning and improvements in documentation, but the provided information should be sufficient for anyone who is interested. Please not the License.
